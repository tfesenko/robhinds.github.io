   <strong>JVM</strong>: I am experienced in a variety of Java APIâ€™s and frameworks. I have recently worked with Spring 4, Spring Boot, JPA (Hibernate and EclipseLink) in addition to others.  In my current role Groovy is the primary language used - and I am familiar with many of the languages features and quirks (including writing <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/articles/functional-programming-groovy">Functional Programming style groovy</a>). <br/><br/>
   <strong>Web Development</strong>: My server side web development experience has largely been based on the Spring MVC framework (although current role uses ColdFusion for server side web stack). I have also worked with some client side technology, having used jQuery, Bootstrap, LESS, SASS and have also experimented with other interesting technologies such as Backbone/Underscore/Require.<br/><br/>
   <strong>Development Control</strong>: I have a good knowledge of application life-cycle management and have worked with SVN, Git, Maven, Gradle, Sonar and Jenkins. I have experience with an array of testing tools and technologies.<br/><br/>
   I have also gained experience and knowledge of other technologies from several side projects and research that I have undertaken in my free time, including Android, a variety of social APIs (Twitter etc) and cloud platforms such as CloudFoundry/OpenShift/AppFog/Parse. <br/><br/>
   As part of Nerdability, I created, and am now primary contributor to, two Spring projects - <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/robhinds/spring-social-geeklist">Spring-Social-Geeklist</a> and <a target='_blank' href="https://github.com/nerdability/spring-social-khan-academy">Spring-Social-Khan-Academy</a>, which provide core integration with those third-party APIs on top of the Spring Social framework. They are both listed as community projects: <a target='_blank' href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/">http://projects.spring.io/spring-social/</a>. <br/><br/>
   I write a blog covering technical and opinion articles that can be found here: <a target='_blank' href="http://automateddeveloper.blogspot.com/">automateddeveloper.blogspot.com</a> (I am also a <a target='_blank' href="https://dzone.com/users/899489/rhinds.html">DZone MVB</a>)
