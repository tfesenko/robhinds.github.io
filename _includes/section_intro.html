		<p>I am a passionate computer programmer, writing mostly in Java and mostly creating tools for other software developers and architects - I was an Eclipse committer, and my current project is a REST API design tool. </p>

		<p>I graduated with honors from St. Petersburg State (Academic) University in Russia with a Masterâ€™s degree in CS and Mathematics more than 10 years ago and l am still actively connected with the academic community, including thesis reviewings. </p>
		<p>I started my career 13 years ago. During these years, I was lucky to work for different kinds of companies, starting with a big American corporation in Russia and later in Europe, then for a French research institution, and now I am a lead developer at a dynamic startup in the US.</p>
